# wallpapers

Wallpapers! Mostly anime ones, but pretty much anything you can categorize. The only requirement is that it's gotta look good.  

Structure:
* Source Directory (e.g Re:Zero)
	* Primary Feature (e.g Character name, such as Echidna)
		* Unique Identifier (e.g EchidnaTeaPartyWithSubaru (or something like that))
			* **[ACTUAL IMAGE FILE]** Format: Resolution[_VariantName].Format

Example: `/Re:Zero/Echidna/EchidnaTeaPartyWithSubaru/1920x1080.jpg`

Slight variations should be added to the same directory, e.g `1920x1080.jpg` + `1920x1080_no_clothes.jpg`
